"""
walkforward.py — per-fold Sharpe sanity check for a strategy.

The default IS/OOS split is a single boundary at 2019-12-31. A strategy
with a real edge should clear (or at least not collapse) in other
non-overlapping 2-year OOS windows too. This CLI computes fold-level
Sharpes on the *currently-checked-out* `strategy.py` and prints a table.

Meant to be run in the morning review on commits marked `keep`:

    git checkout <kept-commit>
    uv run walkforward.py
    git checkout -                           # back to where you were

The harness keeps `generate_weights` the same across folds — this is a
stability check on the weight panel's OOS behavior under different
evaluation windows, not a re-fit. For strategies that genuinely train
parameters, this will under-report their true walk-forward performance;
for lookback/momentum-style strategies it is an honest robustness probe.

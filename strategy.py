strategy.py — XBI losers-mean-reversion (ad-hoc spec ported into harness).

Spec:
  - Every Friday close, rank each name by trailing 1w/1m/3m/6m total return.
    Worst return = rank 1. Average the four ranks.
  - Long the 14 names with the lowest average rank.
  - Inverse 21d realized-vol weights, normalized so sum(w) = 0.35.
  - Hold to next Friday close (T+1 shift applied by run_backtest).

    Contract:
      - Use data up to and including day t to decide target weights for day t.
      - Do NOT apply any shift here. `run_backtest` shifts by one bar to enforce
        T+1 execution — pre-shifting would double-delay your signal.
      - Row sums represent gross leverage; keep it ≤ 1 unless you know what you're doing.

strategy.py — the one file the agent edits.

Define `generate_weights(prices)` that returns a (date × ticker) weight panel.
The __main__ block calls `run_backtest` (which enforces the T+1 shift) and
prints the fixed output block.

Baseline: 12-1 month momentum, monthly rebalance, long top decile equal-weight.
